# Docker ML Cookiecutter

**Helping ML teams easily move to a Docker-first development workflow to iterate and deliver projects faster and more reliably.**

*Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that automatically scaffolds new projects for you based on a template (referred to as cookiecutters):*

This cookiecutter is used in conjunction with a base development image included in the project to provide an out-of-the-box ready environment for many Machine Learning project use cases.
After running this cookiecutter and the provided start script a developer will have a local development setup that looks like this: 

![docker local dev](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifold-public-no-vpn/torus_local_dev.png)

By scaffolding your data science projects using this cookiecutter you will get:

- Project Docker image built with your own Dockerfile for project specific requirements
- Docker Compose configuration that dynamically binds to a free host port and forwards to the jupyter server listening port inside the container
- Shared volume configuration for accessing and executing all your project code inside of the controlled container environment
- Ability to edit code using your favorite IDE on your host machine and seeing real-time changes to the runtime environment
- Jupyter notebook fully configured with nb-extensions ready for development and feature engineering
- Common data science and plotting libraries pre-installed in the container environment to start working immediately

There are several downstream benefits for moving to a container-first workflow in terms of model and inference engine deployment/delivery.
By using containers early in the development cycle you can remove a lot of the configuration management issues that waste developer time and ultimately lower quality of deliverables.

# Project Set-up

## Setting up Version Control

We recommend setting up a remote for Git version control after running `cookiecutter`.  For example, if you want to use GitHub, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), create the repo, and push your local work.

## Setting up Continuous Integration

You can read more about continuous integration and delivery [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html). In its default configuration, we use CI to lint and test code that gets pushed to origin. This is crucial for making sure code is always up to standards. As it currently stands this cookiecutter sets up a CircleCI configuration in the `.circleci` folder.  In future releases we will add other CI options like GitHub actions, Jenkins, etc.  To fully setup CircleCI, after running `cookiecutter` log into log into [circleCI](https://circleci.com/). Click 'Add Projects', select your project, click 'Start Building'.

## MLFlow

You have the option to set up your MLFlow configuration in the cookiecutter questions. These can always be changed later in
the .env. In the prompts, you can set MLflow's tracking URI and MLFlow's artifact location. The prompts for MLFlow in the cookiecutter are:

```
mlflow_uri [/mnt/experiments]:

mlflow_artifact []:
```

`mlflow_uri` sets the URI location. This sets where parameters, metrics, and other [run](run) details are stored. This can be local (default to /mnt/experiments) or a SQL database. The `mlflow_artifact` sets the artifact locations. Artifacts are various files, and they can be stored either on the local filesysm or a cloud storage like S3.  Note that there is additional setup required to use a cloud like AWS -- both S3 bucket setup, RDS setup, and AWS credential management. 

## <a name="setup"></a> Setting up a project
1. Install Docker: 
    - For Mac: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
    - For Windows: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows
    - For Linux: Go to this page and choose the appropriate install for your Linux distro: https://www.docker.com/community-edition
        - Install Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose):
            ```bash
            $ sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
            ```
            ```bash
            $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
            ```
            Test the installation:
            ```bash
            $ docker-compose --version
            docker-compose version 1.21.0, build 1719ceb
            ```
2. Install Python Cookiecutter package: http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html >= 1.4.0
    ``` bash
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```
    It is recommended to set up a central virtualenv or condaenv for cookiecutter and any other "system" wide Python packages you may need.
3. Run the cookiecutter docker data science template to scaffold your new project:
   
   Using HTTPS:
   
    ``` bash
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/rodrigorivera/docker-ml-cookiecutter.git
    ```
    
    or SSH:
    
    ``` bash
    $ cookiecutter git@github.com:rodrigorivera/docker-ml-cookiecutter.git
    ```
4. Answer all of the cookiecutter prompts for project name, description, license, etc.
5. Run the appropriate `make` command from the level of your new project directory.
   If you are running this for the first time, you should build the base images first:
    ``` bash
    $ make init
    ```
   To start the container with the project:
    ``` bash
    $ make dev-start
    ```
6. After the project image builds check which host port is being forwarded to the Jupyter notebook server inside the running container:
    ``` bash
    $ docker ps 
    ```
7. Using any browser access your notebook at localhost:{port}
8. Start working!
